## [0.1.1] -
This includes the Flightdeck Airframe System, a Minimal CSS framework for semantic markup.

### Adds
- Airframe System was added to start theming
  - This includes the `scss` structure which was modified to fit the 7-1 pattern
- Uses Nunjucks `extends` and `blocks` for layouts
- PrismJS theme for code and pre -
- Shortcodes and Macros
  - Shortcodes will be more high-level components - ie: blockquote with citation, card with title, button, photo
  - Macros will be limited to extending content only... ü§î
- 11ty SyntaxHighlighting plugin

### Changed
- total project folder structure
  - `_includes` sticks to the same naming convention as `scss` regarding components
- `.flightdeck.config` has been renamed to `.flightdeck.js` - this is optional, if you would like to use `.eleventy.js` just update the npm run command for `start` and `build`
- 11ty template inheritance is not the same as "vanilla" Nunjucks - so including macros is manual and has to be performed on very page where they are needed.
  - this is limited to just a single include.

- `esbundle.js` renamed to `esBuildAssets.js`

Nothing for this release
